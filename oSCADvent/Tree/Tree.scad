 Today we learn how to create a 2D fractal and extrude it into a modern stylized Tree.
 So what is a fractal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal
 It is called fractal because it covers only a fraction of the area a square would.
 That means it doesn't matter how high we crank the recursion we can never fill all voids.abs
 
 An easy way is to put an object around itself multiple times.
